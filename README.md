# Simulation_data_GLMM
This is the folder that generates data for federated GLMM. 
===========================

Setting 1: 2 sites, 500 patients each site, small variance
Setting 2: 2 sites, 500 patients each site, large variance
Setting 3: 10 sites, 500 patients each site, small variance
Setting 4: 10 sites, 500 patients each site, large variance
Setting 5 ~ 8: four additional settings by changing 500 patients to 30 patients in each hospital

For each setting, 20 datasets are created.
