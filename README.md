# Simulation_data_GLMM
This is the folder that generates data for federated GLMM. 
===========================

Setting 1: 2 sites, 500 patients each site, small variance

Setting 2: 2 sites, 500 patients each site, large variance

Setting 3: 10 sites, 500 patients each site, small variance

Setting 4: 10 sites, 500 patients each site, large variance

Setting 5 ~ 8: four additional settings by changing 500 patients to 30 patients in each hospital

(For each setting, 20 datasets are created.)

### beta0 = c(-1.5,0.1,-0.5,-0.3,0.4,-0.2,-0.25,0.35,-0.1,0.5)
